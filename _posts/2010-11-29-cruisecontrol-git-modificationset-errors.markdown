title: CruiseControl git modificationset errors
excerpt: |
  I encountered some errors while configuring my [phpUnderControl](https://phpundercontrol.org). One of the errors were the `<git>` `<modificationset>` not returning results, but the gitbootstrapper actually updated the git repository. In my case, this was because the user running [CruiseControl](https://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/) has set up colorful output in its git config. This option changes the output of the git-log command. The problem with that? The patterns the modificationset looks for do not match! I opened a [change request on Thoughtworks](https://jira.public.thoughtworks.org/browse/CC-1020) for that - hopefully this will be fixed in the next release of CruiseControl.
  
  The other error was about this warning `Git - warning: Log for '' only goes back to [date]`. This warning is thrown when you don't have _a local reflog_ back to that given date. This happened to me, because I removed the git repository within my build and cloned it on each build. This warning is no problem for the modificationset. However, I didn't want this warning, so I updated my config.xml to use a cleanroom for the bootstrapper and the modificationset. Once built this warning should not occur another time, because you are not loosing the reflog of git anymore. I still clone the repository on each build, but this cleanroom won't be touched anytime.
