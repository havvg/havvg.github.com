title: Behavior Driven Development in Symfony2 with Behat, Mink and Zombie.js
excerpt: |
  Long time no post, but now it’s time for a new one. I wrote a guide on behavior driven development in Symfony2. It’s meant for beginners and designed “from scratch”. This guide caught some attention and made it into the official Behat documentation as a [cookbook entry].

  If you have any feedback on it, please let me know! If you would like to have something related covered, drop me a message!
